# Pokemon-Battle-House
A video game I made in my spare time while in high school. It's not super finished and definitely not super polished, but it has potential and I imagine would be fun to check out. The gameplay style is kind of like a Fire Emblem x Pokemon. Enjoy!

## The Simplest Explanation
Pokemon Battle Haus in its simplest form is a Fire Emblem-esque turn-based strategy game with a Pokemon spin to it. It’s got all the love and charm of the Pokemon creatures with the more stimulating tactical gameplay that come with the mechanics of the Fire Emblem turn based combat system.



# Gameplay
## Battle System
Pokemon Battle Haus, at its core, includes both the overworld map system from Fire Emblem and the turn based typed matchups battle system that Pokemon had. My goal when creating the game was to make a more challenging and interesting Pokemon game that two people could sit down and play.

One difference however, from the actual Fire Emblem combat system is that there is no weapon triangle. Instead when two Pokemon come in contact with each other, a Pokemon battle will ensue. Each Pokemon will be able to attack once, with the Pokemon who initiated the battle attacking first.

## Maps
As shown by the screenshots, the game involves a tile-based map with different terrains being represented by different tiles. The tiles used were all taken from a Minecraft texture pack called Dokucraft, which I was particularly fond of at the time.

## Play it with Friends
While there is no online mode yet, the game is still a two player game. The game displays who’s turn it is so passing and playing is the funnest way to play. The game doesn’t require a lot of concentration so playing next to a friend is the best way to experience the game as it allows for personal contact and light conversation.

## Future Goals
It’s unfortunate that a lot of the ideas I had for this game were never fully realized (at least not yet they weren’t). Below are some of the features I was planning to add into the game but never got around to it before I quit working on the project.

- Ability to choose your Pokemon team
- Procedural generation of the map with different terrain and biomes that affect the battle system
- Items that would be scattered across the map
- Button to speed up movement (was implemented at one point)
- Online battles

## Contribute to the Project
As much as I would love to rebuild this entire game from the ground up, I’m afraid I simply don’t have the time or passion to do that anymore. My interests have evolved past making mediocre video games out of what I once thought were good ideas. The fact of the matter is that I lose interest to quickly in what I do and am always chasing something new.

However, I will say that I love seeing ideas I once had be done well, even if it’s not by me but someone else. This is why I posted the project on GitHub and am writing this; I would love for someone to come by and take over the project. I could be a great big help in giving ideas about what was next to come in the game’s development cycle. I would also be an invaluable resource in explaining the code, which brings me to my next point…

There’s something you should know if you want to contribute to this project. At the moment, it has just about no documentation. Allow me to explain before you crucify me anyways. There was documentation at one point in time. In fact, the game was actually much further along than what you see in the demo video and what’s on github. However, after I lost the flash drive where the game was stored I had to use a previous version stored on my google drive, for younger Roman was inexperienced when it came to using GitHub.

Don’t let this stop you from contributing to the project. In fact, if you contact me, I would be more than glad to write up some docs for the entire project and document each line of code. It would really make my day if someone took an interest in something I had once invested a lot of time in.

# What you need to know
Pokemon Battle Haus operates based on a Game State Manager system. The best explanation of this system can be found in this series of videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dzhgsVaiSo&list=PLX0xZJGWHYp2wPT9QLu7uAnDDZeUP9p77. These videos are a great resource for understanding how to do basic game programming in Java. Once you've understood the basics of this, the code isn't too difficult to understand!
